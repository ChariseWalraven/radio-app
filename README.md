Notes to the adjudicators:

- I don't have an Apple developer account, so this app was not tested on iOS. If you're planning on using an iPhone, please keep this in mind.
- The debug build has a testing page that can be reached via the last navigation item in the bottom bar.

# B-Radio CL

The starting code for the B-Synergy Flutter contest 2022 The contest is adjudicated by the judges and is based who presented the best app, based on the following broad criteria:

* Functionality - what new functionality did you add to make the app more like a proper radio app. Some ideas:
  * Cleaning up the data - removing duplicates etc.
  * Looking at stations beyond the Netherlands.
  * Dig around the api - what else could be interesting to use?
  * Filtering on users favorite tags.
  * User's list of favourite stations.
  * Persist app data (hint: use hive).
* UI - what improvements did you add to the UI make it look better.
* Architecture - to what extent did your new code stick to the principle of seperation of concerns.
* Code quality - is the code you added clear, readable while concise and 'Flutter like'.

## Contest Rules

* The judges are Paul Schunk & Chris Laurie. They may ask additional people to assist, at their own discretion.
* The prize money is €500. How this is finally awarded is at the sole discretion of the judges.
